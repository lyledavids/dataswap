# üíæ DataSwap ‚Äì Decentralized AI/Data Marketplace
 *Buy, sell, and compute on datasets ‚Äî fully decentralized.*

---

## 1. Concept
DataSwap is a **peer-to-peer marketplace** for datasets, aimed at AI researchers, data scientists, and ML teams.  
Users can upload datasets to **Filecoin Warm Storage**, monetize them, or purchase datasets from others, using **Filecoin Pay** for secure payments.  

Key points:  
- On-chain dataset metadata ensures trust and transparency.  
- Fast retrieval through **FilCDN**.  
- Optional ‚Äúcompute-over-data‚Äù feature allows buyers to test datasets before purchase.

## 2. Core Features
### ‚ö° a) Dataset Upload & Storage
- Users upload datasets (CSV, JSON, images, audio).  
- Stored via **FilecoinWarmStorageService** with **PDP verification**.  
- Metadata stored on-chain: name, description, size, type, sample preview, license.  

### ‚ö° b) Marketplace & Discovery
- Browsable dataset catalog by category (NLP, vision, audio, tabular).  
- Search, filter, and preview datasets without full download.  
- Optional tagging system for better discoverability.  

### ‚ö° c) Payment & Access
- Buyers pay via **Filecoin Pay**: one-time or subscription access.  
- Streaming payments supported for datasets that update frequently.  
- Revenue automatically settles to dataset owner wallet.  

### ‚ö° d) Secure Retrieval & CDN
- Access datasets via **FilCDN** for blazing-fast download.  
- Optional time-limited access: dataset automatically becomes inaccessible after subscription ends.  

### ‚ö° e) Compute-over-Data (Optional)
- Buyers can run light preprocessing scripts on datasets **without full download**.  
- Example: run a small model evaluation on images or perform summary stats.  
- Payments handled per compute job or included in subscription.  

### ‚ö° f) Synapse SDK Integration
- JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for direct integration with ML workflows.  
- Example: `loadDataset('datasetID')` fetches dataset from Filecoin into Colab or local environment.

## 3. Flow
1. **Dataset Upload**
   - User uploads a small example dataset (~100MB).  
   - Stored in warm storage ‚Üí PDP verification passes.  
   - Metadata saved on-chain.  

2. **Dataset Discovery**
   - Another user browses marketplace, previews dataset.  
   - Searches by category/tag.  

3. **Purchase / Access**
   - Buyer pays via **Filecoin Pay** (one-time or subscription).  
   - Dataset delivered via **FilCDN**.  

4. **Optional Compute**
   - Buyer runs a test script on dataset before fully committing.  
   - Usage measured and billing handled via Filecoin Pay.  

5. **Revenue Flow**
   - Dataset owner wallet receives FIL instantly.

## 4. Architecture 
- **Frontend DApp**: React + Tailwind (shadcn/ui) for upload, marketplace, and dashboards.  
- **Filecoin Warm Storage**: stores datasets with PDP verification.  
- **FilCDN**: serves datasets fast to buyers.  
- **Filecoin Pay**: handles one-time and streaming payments, escrow, and settlement.  
- **Synapse SDK**: integrates datasets directly into ML workflows.  

**Data Flow:**  
1. Provider uploads dataset ‚Üí Warm Storage ‚Üí PDP verification ‚Üí on-chain metadata.  
2. Buyer discovers dataset ‚Üí previews metadata.  
3. Buyer pays via Filecoin Pay ‚Üí access granted via FilCDN.  
4. Optional compute jobs run via Synapse SDK ‚Üí paid per job.  
5. Provider receives revenue instantly.

## 5. Why
- DataSwap unlocks **trusted, decentralized datasets** for AI & ML teams.  
- Eliminates central data brokers ‚Üí creators monetize directly.  
- Combines **storage, payment, and CDN** into a **single composable dApp**.  
- Judges see immediate utility: ‚ÄúAI teams can pay and use datasets securely and instantly.‚Äù

## 6. Extensions / Future Roadmap
- Ratings & reviews for datasets.  
- Dataset versioning & auto-updates with streaming payments.  
- Integration with AI model marketplaces.  
- Governance DAO for curation and dataset verification.
